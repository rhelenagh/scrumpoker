# scrumpoker
Poker planning implementation, using Flutter for the client and Deno as the backend.

Communication between the client and the server will be done using Websockets.

## Requirements:
- Have Flutter for Web ðŸ˜‰ installed more in https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/web
- Install Deno from https://deno.land/#installation

## Disclaimer
- I'm not a Flutter expert.
- Flutter for Web is currently in beta.
- I'm not an expert in Deno.

The objective is "Learning by doing" and the desire to face new challenges.

Everyone can contribute to the project.
